# Adds factory methods like: future, event, delay, schedule, zip, ...
# otherwise they can be called on Promises module
include Concurrent::Promises::FactoryMethods 


### Simple asynchronous task

future = future { sleep 0.1; 1 + 1 } # evaluation starts immediately
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc1e5340 pending blocks:[]>
future.completed?                                  # => false
# block until evaluated
future.value                                       # => 2
future.completed?                                  # => true


### Failing asynchronous task

future = future { raise 'Boom' }
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc1dc808 pending blocks:[]>
future.value                                       # => nil
future.value! rescue $!                            # => #<RuntimeError: Boom>
future.reason                                      # => #<RuntimeError: Boom>
# re-raising
raise future rescue $!                             # => #<RuntimeError: Boom>

### Direct creation of completed futures

succeeded_future(Object.new)
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc1c6030 success blocks:[]>
failed_future(StandardError.new("boom"))
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc1c50b8 failed blocks:[]>

### Chaining of futures

head    = succeeded_future 1 
branch1 = head.then(&:succ) 
branch2 = head.then(&:succ).then(&:succ) 
branch1.zip(branch2).value!                        # => [2, 3]
# zip is aliased as &
(branch1 & branch2).then { |a, b| a + b }.value!   # => 5
(branch1 & branch2).then(&:+).value!               # => 5
# or a class method zip from FactoryMethods can be used to zip multiple futures
zip(branch1, branch2, branch1).then { |*values| values.reduce &:+ }.value!
    # => 7
# pick only first completed
any(branch1, branch2).value!                       # => 2
(branch1 | branch2).value!                         # => 2


### Arguments

# any supplied arguments are passed to the block, promises ensure that they are visible to the block

future('3') { |s| s.to_i }.then(2) { |a, b| a + b }.value
    # => 5
succeeded_future(1).then(2, &:+).value             # => 3
succeeded_future(1).chain(2) { |success, value, reason, arg| value + arg }.value
    # => 3


### Error handling

succeeded_future(Object.new).then(&:succ).then(&:succ).rescue { |e| e.class }.value # error propagates
    # => NoMethodError
succeeded_future(Object.new).then(&:succ).rescue { 1 }.then(&:succ).value # rescued and replaced with 1
    # => 2
succeeded_future(1).then(&:succ).rescue { |e| e.message }.then(&:succ).value # no error, rescue not applied
    # => 3

failing_zip = succeeded_future(1) & failed_future(StandardError.new('boom'))
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc11ec90 failed blocks:[]>
failing_zip.result                                 # => [false, [1, nil], [nil, #<StandardError: boom>]]
failing_zip.then { |v| 'never happens' }.result    # => [false, [1, nil], [nil, #<StandardError: boom>]]
failing_zip.rescue { |a, b| (a || b).message }.value
    # => "boom"
failing_zip.chain { |success, values, reasons| [success, values.compact, reasons.compactÃŸ] }.value
    # => nil


### Delay

# will not evaluate until asked by #value or other method requiring completion
future = delay { 'lazy' }
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc0ff660 pending blocks:[]>
sleep 0.1 
future.completed?                                  # => false
future.value                                       # => "lazy"

# propagates trough chain allowing whole or partial lazy chains

head    = delay { 1 }
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc0fc938 pending blocks:[]>
branch1 = head.then(&:succ)
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc0df068 pending blocks:[]>
branch2 = head.delay.then(&:succ)
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc0dd178 pending blocks:[]>
join    = branch1 & branch2
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5cc0dc430 pending blocks:[]>

sleep 0.1 # nothing will complete                  # => 0
[head, branch1, branch2, join].map(&:completed?)   # => [false, false, false, false]

branch1.value                                      # => 2
sleep 0.1 # forces only head to complete, branch 2 stays incomplete
    # => 0
[head, branch1, branch2, join].map(&:completed?)   # => [true, true, false, false]

join.value                                         # => [2, 2]
[head, branch1, branch2, join].map(&:completed?)   # => [true, true, true, true]


### Flatting

# waits for inner future, only the last call to value blocks thread
future { future { 1+1 } }.flat.value               # => 2

# more complicated example
future { future { future { 1 + 1 } } }.
    flat(1).
    then { |f| f.then(&:succ) }.
    flat(1).value                                  # => 3


### Schedule

# it'll be executed after 0.1 seconds
scheduled = schedule(0.1) { 1 }
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5caaae028 pending blocks:[]>

scheduled.completed?                               # => false
scheduled.value # available after 0.1sec           # => 1

# and in chain
scheduled = delay { 1 }.schedule(0.1).then(&:succ)
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5caa9f2d0 pending blocks:[]>
# will not be scheduled until value is requested
sleep 0.1 
scheduled.value # returns after another 0.1sec     # => 2


### Completable Future and Event

future = completable_future
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::CompletableFuture:0x7fc5caa8eae8 pending blocks:[]>
event  = event()
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::CompletableEvent:0x7fc5caa8d648 pending blocks:[]>

# These threads will be blocked until the future and event is completed
t1     = Thread.new { future.value } 
t2     = Thread.new { event.wait } 

future.success 1
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::CompletableFuture:0x7fc5caa8eae8 success blocks:[]>
future.success 1 rescue $!
    # => #<Concurrent::MultipleAssignmentError: Future can be completed only once. Current result is [true, 1, nil], trying to set [true, 1, nil]>
future.try_success 2                               # => false
event.complete
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::CompletableEvent:0x7fc5caa8d648 completed blocks:[]>

# The threads can be joined now
[t1, t2].each &:join 


### Callbacks

queue  = Queue.new                                 # => #<Thread::Queue:0x007fc5caa770c8>
future = delay { 1 + 1 }
    # => <#Concurrent::Promises::Future:0x7fc5caa754d0 pending blocks:[]>

future.on_success { queue << 1 } # evaluated asynchronously

queue.pop                                          # => 1


### Thread-pools

# Factory methods are taking names of the global executors
# (ot instances of custom executors)

# executed on :fast executor, only short and non-blocking tasks can go there
future_on(:fast) { 2 }.
    # executed on executor for blocking and long operations
    then_on(:io) { File.read __FILE__ }.
    wait

actor.ask(2).then(&:succ).value                    # => 5
