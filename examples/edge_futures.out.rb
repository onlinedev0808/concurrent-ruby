### Simple asynchronous task

future = Concurrent.future { sleep 0.1; 1 + 1 } # evaluation starts immediately
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::Future:0x7fcc73208180 pending blocks:[]>
future.completed?                                  # => false
# block until evaluated
future.value                                       # => 2
future.completed?                                  # => true


### Failing asynchronous task

future = Concurrent.future { raise 'Boom' }
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::Future:0x7fcc731fa0a8 pending blocks:[]>
future.value                                       # => nil
future.value! rescue $!                            # => #<RuntimeError: Boom>
future.reason                                      # => #<RuntimeError: Boom>
# re-raising
raise future rescue $!                             # => #<RuntimeError: Boom>


### Chaining

head    = Concurrent.succeeded_future 1 
branch1 = head.then(&:succ) 
branch2 = head.then(&:succ).then(&:succ) 
branch1.zip(branch2).value!                        # => [2, 3]
(branch1 & branch2).then { |a, b| a + b }.value!   # => 5
(branch1 & branch2).then(&:+).value!               # => 5
Concurrent.zip(branch1, branch2, branch1).then { |*values| values.reduce &:+ }.value!
    # => 7
# pick only first completed
(branch1 | branch2).value!                         # => 2

### Error handling

Concurrent.future { Object.new }.then(&:succ).then(&:succ).rescue { |e| e.class }.value # error propagates
    # => NoMethodError
Concurrent.future { Object.new }.then(&:succ).rescue { 1 }.then(&:succ).value
    # => 2
Concurrent.future { 1 }.then(&:succ).rescue { |e| e.message }.then(&:succ).value
    # => 3

failing_zip = Concurrent.succeeded_future(1) & Concurrent.failed_future(StandardError.new('boom'))
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::Future:0x7fcc731c00b0 failed blocks:[]>
failing_zip.result                                 # => [false, [1, nil], [nil, #<StandardError: boom>]]
failing_zip.then { |v| 'never happens' }.result    # => [false, [1, nil], [nil, #<StandardError: boom>]]
failing_zip.rescue { |a, b| (a || b).message }.value
    # => "boom"
failing_zip.chain { |success, values, reasons| [success, values.compact, reasons.compactÃŸ] }.value
    # => nil

### Delay

# will not evaluate until asked by #value or other method requiring completion
future = Concurrent.delay { 'lazy' }

[head, branch1, branch2, join].map(&:completed?)   # => [false, false, false, false]

branch1.value                                      # => 2

[head, branch1, branch2, join].map(&:completed?)   # => [true, true, false, false]

join.value                                         # => [2, 2]


### Flatting

Concurrent.future { Concurrent.future { 1+1 } }.flat.value # waits for inner future
    # => 2

# more complicated example
Concurrent.future { Concurrent.future { Concurrent.future { 1 + 1 } } }.
    flat(1).
    then { |f| f.then(&:succ) }.
    flat(1).value                                  # => 3

    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::Future:0x7fcc73143e48 pending blocks:[]>

scheduled.completed?                               # => false
scheduled.value # available after 0.1sec           # => 1

# and in chain
scheduled = Concurrent.delay { 1 }.schedule(0.1).then(&:succ)
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::Future:0x7fcc7313a758 pending blocks:[]>
# will not be scheduled until value is requested
sleep 0.1 
scheduled.value # returns after another 0.1sec     # => 2


### Completable Future and Event

future = Concurrent.future
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::CompletableFuture:0x7fcc731286e8 pending blocks:[]>
event  = Concurrent.event
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::CompletableEvent:0x7fcc73123058 pending blocks:[]>
# Don't forget to keep the reference, `Concurrent.future.then { |v| v }` is incompletable

# will be blocked until completed
t1     = Thread.new { future.value }
