### Simple asynchronous task

future = Concurrent.future { sleep 0.1; 1 + 1 } # evaluation starts immediately
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::Future:0x7fc6218f2318 pending blocks:[]>
future.completed?                                  # => false
# block until evaluated
future.value                                       # => 2
future.completed?                                  # => true


### Failing asynchronous task

future = Concurrent.future { raise 'Boom' }
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::Future:0x7fc6218eae38 pending blocks:[]>
future.value                                       # => nil
future.value! rescue $!                            # => #<RuntimeError: Boom>
future.reason                                      # => #<RuntimeError: Boom>
# re-raising
raise future rescue $!                             # => #<RuntimeError: Boom>


### Chaining

head    = Concurrent.completed_future 1 
branch1 = head.then(&:succ) 
branch2 = head.then(&:succ).then(&:succ) 
branch1.zip(branch2).value!                        # => [2, 3]

    # => 7
# pick only first completed
(branch1 | branch2).value!                         # => 2

### Error handling

Concurrent.future { Object.new }.then(&:succ).then(&:succ).rescue { |e| e.class }.value # error propagates
    # => NoMethodError
Concurrent.future { Object.new }.then(&:succ).rescue { 1 }.then(&:succ).value

failing_zip.then { |v| 'never happens' }.result    # => [false, [1, nil], [nil, #<RuntimeError: boom>]]
failing_zip.rescue { |a, b| (a || b).message }.value
    # => "boom"
failing_zip.chain { |success, values, reasons| [success, values.compact, reasons.compactß] }.value
    # => nil

### Delay

join.value                                         # => [2, 2]


### Flatting

Concurrent.future { Concurrent.future { 1+1 } }.flat.value # waits for inner future
    # => 2

# more complicated example
Concurrent.future { Concurrent.future { Concurrent.future { 1 + 1 } } }.
    flat(1).
    then { |f| f.then(&:succ) }.

# will not be scheduled until value is requested
sleep 0.1 
scheduled.value # returns after another 0.1sec     # => 2


### Completable Future and Event

future = Concurrent.future
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::CompletableFuture:0x7fc623083720 pending blocks:[]>
event  = Concurrent.event
    # => <#Concurrent::Edge::CompletableEvent:0x7fc623081100 pending blocks:[]>
