module Concurrent

  # A very common currency pattern is to run a thread that performs a task at regular
  # intervals. The thread that peforms the task sleeps for the given interval then
  # wakes up and performs the task. Lather, rinse, repeat... This pattern causes two
  # problems. First, it is difficult to test the business logic of the task becuse the
  # task itself is tightly coupled with the concurrency logic. Second, an exception in
  # raised while performing the task can cause the entire thread to abend. In a
  # long-running application where the task thread is intended to run for days/weeks/years
  # a crashed task thread can pose a significant problem. +TimerTask+ alleviates both problems.
  # 
  # When a +TimerTask+ is launched it starts a thread for monitoring the execution interval.
  # The +TimerTask+ thread does not perform the task, however. Instead, the TimerTask
  # launches the task on a separate thread. Should the task experience an unrecoverable
  # crash only the task thread will crash. This makes the +TimerTask+ very fault tolerant
  # Additionally, the +TimerTask+ thread can respond to the success or failure of the task,
  # performing logging or ancillary operations. +TimerTask+ can also be configured with a
  # timeout value allowing it to kill a task that runs too long.
  # 
  # One other advantage of +TimerTask+ is it forces the bsiness logic to be completely decoupled
  # from the concurrency logic. The business logic can be tested separately then passed to the
  # +TimerTask+ for scheduling and running.
  # 
  # In some cases it may be necessary for a +TimerTask+ to affect its own execution cycle.
  # To facilitate this a reference to the task object is passed into the block as a block
  # argument every time the task is executed.
  # 
  # The +TimerTask+ class includes the +Dereferenceable+ mixin module so the result of
  # the last execution is always available via the +#value+ method. Derefencing options
  # can be passed to the +TimerTask+ during construction or at any later time using the
  # +#set_deref_options+ method.
  # 
  # +TimerTask+ supports notification through the Ruby standard library
  # {http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html Observable}
  # module. On execution the +TimerTask+ will notify the observers
  # with threes arguments: time of execution, the result of the block (or nil on failure),
  # and any raised exceptions (or nil on success). If the timeout interval is exceeded
  # the observer will receive a +Concurrent::TimeoutError+ object as the third argument.
  #
  # @example Basic usage
  #   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new{ puts 'Boom!' }
  #   task.run!
  #   
  #   task.execution_interval #=> 60 (default)
  #   task.timeout_interval   #=> 30 (default)
  #   
  #   # wait 60 seconds...
  #   #=> 'Boom!'
  #   
  #   task.stop #=> true
  #
  # @example Configuring +:execution_interval+ and +:timeout_interval+
  #   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(execution_interval: 5, timeout_interval: 5) do
  #          puts 'Boom!'
  #        end
  #   
  #   task.execution_interval #=> 5
  #   task.timeout_interval   #=> 5
  #
  # @example Immediate execution with +:run_now+
  #   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(run_now: true){ puts 'Boom!' }
  #   task.run!
  #   
  #   #=> 'Boom!'
  #
  # @example Last +#value+ and +Dereferenceable+ mixin
  #   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(
  #     dup_on_deref: true,
  #     execution_interval: 5
  #   ){ Time.now }
  #   
  #   task.run!
  #   Time.now   #=> 2013-11-07 18:06:50 -0500
  #   sleep(10)
  #   task.value #=> 2013-11-07 18:06:55 -0500
  #
  # @example Controlling execution from within the block
  #   timer_task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(execution_interval: 1) do |task|
  #     task.execution_interval.times{ print 'Boom! ' }
  #     print "\n"
  #     task.execution_interval += 1
  #     if task.execution_interval > 5
  #       puts 'Stopping...'
  #       task.stop
  #     end
  #   end
  #   
  #   timer_task.run # blocking call - this task will stop itself
  #   #=> Boom!
  #   #=> Boom! Boom!
  #   #=> Boom! Boom! Boom!
  #   #=> Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
  #   #=> Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
  #   #=> Stopping...
  #
  # @example Observation
  #   class TaskObserver
  #     def update(time, result, ex)
  #       if result
  #         print "(#{time}) Execution successfully returned #{result}\n"
  #       elsif ex.is_a?(Concurrent::TimeoutError)
  #         print "(#{time}) Execution timed out\n"
  #       else
  #         print "(#{time}) Execution failed with error #{ex}\n"
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #   
  #   task = Concurrent::TimerTask.new(execution_interval: 1, timeout_interval: 1){ 42 }
