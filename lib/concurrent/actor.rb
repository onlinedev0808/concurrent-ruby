module Concurrent

  # Actor-based concurrency is all the rage in some circles. Originally described in
  # 1973, the actor model is a paradigm for creating asynchronous, concurrent objects
  # that is becoming increasingly popular. Much has changed since actors were first
  # written about four decades ago, which has led to a serious fragmentation within
  # the actor community. There is *no* universally accepted, strict definition of
  # "actor" and actor implementations differ widely between languages and libraries.
  # 
  # A good definition of "actor" is:
  # 
  #   An independent, concurrent, single-purpose, computational entity that communicates exclusively via message passing.
  # 
  # The +Concurrent::Actor+ class in this library is based solely on the
  # {http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.actors.Actor Actor} trait
  # defined in the Scala standard library. It does not implement all the features of
  # Scala's +Actor+ but its behavior for what *has* been implemented is nearly identical.
  # The excluded features mostly deal with Scala's message semantics, strong typing,
  # and other characteristics of Scala that don't really apply to Ruby.
  # 
  # Unlike many of the abstractions in this library, +Actor+ takes an *object-oriented*
  # approach to asynchronous concurrency, rather than a *functional programming*
  # approach.
  #   
  # Because +Actor+ mixes in the +Concurrent::Runnable+ module subclasses have access to
  # the +#on_error+ method and can override it to implement custom error handling. The
  # +Actor+ base class does not use +#on_error+ so as to avoid conflit with subclasses
  # which override it. Generally speaking, +#on_error+ should not be used. The +Actor+
  # base class provides concictent, reliable, and robust error handling already, and
  # error handling specifics are tied to the message posting method. Incorrect behavior
  # in an +#on_error+ override can lead to inconsistent +Actor+ behavior that may lead
  # to confusion and difficult debugging.
  #   
  # The +Actor+ superclass mixes in the Ruby standard library
  # {http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html Observable}
  # module to provide consistent callbacks upon message processing completion. The normal
  # +Observable+ methods, including +#add_observer+ behave normally. Once an observer
  # is added to an +Actor+ it will be notified of all messages processed *after*
  # addition. Notification will *not* occur for any messages that have already been
  # processed.
  #   
  # Observers will be notified regardless of whether the message processing is successful
  # or not. The +#update+ method of the observer will receive four arguments. The
  # appropriate method signature is:
  #   
  #   def update(time, message, result, reason)
  #   
  # These four arguments represent:
  #   
  # * The time that message processing was completed
  # * An array containing all elements of the original message, in order
  # * The result of the call to +#act+ (will be +nil+ if an exception was raised)
  # * Any exception raised by +#act+ (or +nil+ if message processing was successful)
  #
  # @example Actor Ping Pong
  #   class Ping < Concurrent::Actor
  #   
  #     def initialize(count, pong)
  #       super()
  #       @pong = pong
  #       @remaining = count

  #         print "Ping: pong\n" if @remaining % 1000 == 0

  #         if @remaining > 0
