  # A `Future` represents a promise to complete an action at some time in the future.
  # The action is atomic and permanent. The idea behind a future is to send an operation
  # for asynchronous completion, do other stuff, then return and retrieve the result
  # of the async operation at a later time.
  #
  # A `Future` has four possible states: *:unscheduled*, *:pending*, *:rejected*, or *:fulfilled*.
  # When a `Future` is created its state is set to *:unscheduled*. Once the `#execute` method is
  # called the state becomes *:pending* and will remain in that state until processing is
  # complete. A completed `Future` is either *:rejected*, indicating that an exception was
  # thrown during processing, or *:fulfilled*, indicating success. If a `Future` is *:fulfilled*
  # its `value` will be updated to reflect the result of the operation. If *:rejected* the
  # `reason` will be updated with a reference to the thrown exception. The predicate methods
  # `#unscheduled?`, `#pending?`, `#rejected?`, and `fulfilled?` can be called at any time to
  # obtain the state of the `Future`, as can the `#state` method, which returns a symbol. 
  #
  # Retrieving the value of a `Future` is done through the `#value` (alias: `#deref`) method.
  # Obtaining the value of a `Future` is a potentially blocking operation. When a `Future` is
  # *:rejected* a call to `#value` will return `nil` immediately. When a `Future` is
  # *:fulfilled* a call to `#value` will immediately return the current value. When a
  # `Future` is *:pending* a call to `#value` will block until the `Future` is either
  # *:rejected* or *:fulfilled*. A *timeout* value can be passed to `#value` to limit how
  # long the call will block. If `nil` the call will block indefinitely. If `0` the call will
  # not block. Any other integer or float value will indicate the maximum number of seconds to block.
  #
  # The `Future` class also includes the behavior of the Ruby standard library `Observable` module,
  # but does so in a thread-safe way. On fulfillment or rejection all observers will be notified
  # according to the normal `Observable` behavior. The observer callback function will be called
  # with three parameters: the `Time` of fulfillment/rejection, the final `value`, and the final
  # `reason`. Observers added after fulfillment/rejection will still be notified as normal.
