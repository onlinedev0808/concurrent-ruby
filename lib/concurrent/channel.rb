module Concurrent

  # +Channel+ is a functional programming variation of +Actor+, based very loosely on the
  # *MailboxProcessor* agent in F#. +Actor+ is used to create objects that receive messages
  # from other threads then processes those messages based on the behavior of the class.
  # +Channel+ creates objects that receive messages and processe them using the block
  # given at construction. +Channel+ is implemented as a subclass of +Actor+ and supports
  # all message-passing methods of that class. +Channel+ also supports pools with a shared
  # mailbox.
  #
  # @example Basic usage
  #   channel = Concurrent::Channel.new do |msg|
  #     sleep(1)
  #     puts "#{msg}\n"
  #   end
  #   
  #   channel.run! => #<Thread:0x007fa123d95fc8 sleep>
  #   
  #   channel.post("Hello, World!") => 1
  #   # wait...
  #   => Hello, World!
  #   
  #   future = channel.post? "Don't Panic." => #<Concurrent::IVar:0x007fa123d6d9d8 @state=:pending...
  #   future.pending? => true
  #   # wait...
  #   => "Don't Panic."
  #   future.fulfilled? => true
  #   
  #   channel.stop => true
