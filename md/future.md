# We're Sending You Back to the Future!

`Future`s are inspired by [Clojure's](http://clojure.org/) [future](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/future)
function. A future represents a promise to complete an action at some time in the future.
The action is atomic and permanent. The idea behind a future is to send an operation for
asynchronous completion, do other stuff, then return and retrieve the result of the async
operation at a later time. `Future`s run on the global thread pool (see below).

`Future`s have three possible states: *pending*, *rejected*, and *fulfilled*. When a `Future` is created it is set
to *pending* and will remain in that state until processing is complete. A completed `Future` is either *rejected*,
indicating that an exception was thrown during processing, or *fulfilled*, indicating succedd. If a `Future` is
*fulfilled* its `value` will be updated to reflect the result of the operation. If *rejected* the `reason` will
be updated with a reference to the thrown exception. The predicate methods `pending?`, `rejected`, and `fulfilled?`
can be called at any time to obtain the state of the `Future`, as can the `state` method, which returns a symbol.

Retrieving the value of a `Future` is done through the `value` (alias: `deref`) method. Obtaining the value of
a `Future` is a potentially blocking operation. When a `Future` is *rejected* a call to `value` will return `nil`
immediately. When a `Future` is *fulfilled* a call to `value` will immediately return the current value.
When a `Future` is *pending* a call to `value` will block until the `Future` is either *rejected* or *fulfilled*.
A *timeout* value can be passed to `value` to limit how long the call will block. If `nil` the call will
block indefinitely. If `0` the call will not block. Any other integer or float value will indicate the
maximum number of seconds to block.

The constructor can also be given zero or more processing options. Currently the
only supported options are those recognized by the
[Dereferenceable](https://github.com/jdantonio/concurrent-ruby/blob/master/md/dereferenceable.md)
module.

The `Future` class also includes the Ruby standard library
[Observable](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html) module. On fulfillment
or rejection all observers will be notified according to the normal `Observable` behavior. The observer
callback function will be called with three parameters: the `Time` of fulfillment/rejection, the
final `value`, and the final `reason`. Observers added after fulfillment/rejection will still be
notified as normal. The notification will occur on the global thread pool.

## Examples

A fulfilled example:

```ruby
require 'concurrent'

count = Concurrent::Future.new{ sleep(10); 10 }.execute
count.state #=> :pending
count.pending? #=> true

# do stuff...

count.value(0) #=> nil (does not block)

count.value #=> 10 (after blocking)
count.state #=> :fulfilled
count.fulfilled? #=> true
count.value #=> 10
```

A rejected example:

```ruby
count = Concurrent::Future.execute{ sleep(10); raise StandardError.new("Boom!") }
count.state #=> :pending
count.pending? #=> true

deref(count) #=> nil (after blocking)
count.rejected? #=> true
count.reason #=> #<StandardError: Boom!> 
```

An example with observation:

```ruby
class Ticker
  Stock = Struct.new(:symbol, :name, :exchange)

  def update(time, value, reason)
    ticker = value.collect do |symbol|
      Stock.new(symbol['symbol'], symbol['name'], symbol['exch'])
    end

    output = ticker.join("\n")
    print "#{output}\n"
  end
end

yahoo = Finance.new('YAHOO')
future = Concurrent::Future.new { yahoo.update.suggested_symbols }
future.add_observer(Ticker.new)
future.execute

# do important stuff...

#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YHOO", name="Yahoo! Inc.", exchange="NMS">
#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YHO.DE", name="Yahoo! Inc.", exchange="GER">
#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YAHOY", name="Yahoo Japan Corporation", exchange="PNK">
#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YAHOF", name="YAHOO JAPAN CORP", exchange="PNK">
#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YOJ.SG", name="YAHOO JAPAN", exchange="STU">
#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YHO.SG", name="YAHOO", exchange="STU">
#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YHOO.BA", name="Yahoo! Inc.", exchange="BUE">
#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YHO.DU", name="YAHOO", exchange="DUS">
#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YHO.HM", name="YAHOO", exchange="HAM">
#>> #<struct Ticker::Stock symbol="YHO.BE", name="YAHOO", exchange="BER">
```
