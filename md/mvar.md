# MVar

An `MVar` is a synchronized single element container. They are empty or contain
one item. Taking a value from an empty `MVar` blocks, as does putting a value
into a full one. You can either think of them as blocking queue of length one,
or a special kind of mutable variable.

On top of the fundamental `#put` and `#take` operations, we also provide a
`#mutate` that is atomic with respect to operations on the same instance. These
operations all support timeouts.

We also support non-blocking operations `#try_put!` and `#try_take!`, a `#set!`
that ignores existing values, a `#value` that returns the value without removing
it or returns `MVar::EMPTY`, and a `#modify!` that yields `MVar::EMPTY` if the
`MVar` is empty and can be used to set `MVar::EMPTY`. You shouldn't use these
operations in the first instance.

`MVar` is a Dereferenceable.

`MVar` is related to M-structures in Id, `MVar` in Haskell and `SyncVar` in
Scala.

Note that unlike the original Haskell paper, our `#take` is blocking. This is
how Haskell and Scala do it today.
